# June17MEANJSLib


Fork this repo. You will then have your own June17MEANJSLib repo.

Clone your June17MEANJSLib repo into your local machine. DO NOT clone it into an existing git repo!!!!

Navigate into the June17MEANDJSLib project in your local machine and add your work. If your project already exists in another directory, you can either move it or copy it in. If your project is already a git repo, get rid of that repo. Ask if you have any questions about how to do that (hint, git makes a hidden directory called .git in your project). To minimize potential merge conflicts, please put your work in a uniquely-named directory.

Git add, git commit, and git push to your own remote repo.

Submit a pull request.
